This is a step by step rebuild of the popular Social Media app (Quora). Built with Vite + React and imbedded with dependencies like Tailwind.css, React router, React Icons. As I uild further i will be documnting every progress I make each day.

The Goal: To build the app to a working mvp ready to be used with most of its basic features working and functional. | Build this in a week. Sounds Unreal but its personal challenge! Let's GO!!!
